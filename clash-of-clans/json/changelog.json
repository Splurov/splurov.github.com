In the column “Quantity”, as usual, make 100 Barbarians and 100 Archers. And in the column “Subtract” 20 Barbarians. Now the distribution between the barracks are considered to be only for 80 Barbarians and 100 Archers. This is very useful, when after the battle you have remained part of the army</span>"
